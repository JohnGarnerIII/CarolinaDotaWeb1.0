<h2>Final Process and Design</h2>
<h3> November, 17th 2019 </h3>
<p>It’s so nice to finally be almost done with everything. I am dreading this presentation so much. I don’t know how everyone else will do and how I will stack up with the competition. To be honest I just want to present and for it to be over with so I can enjoy my long-lasting break of studying for my other 3 classes.  Sarcasm aside, I’m mostly happy with the way the website turned out.</p>

<br>

<p>I initially wanted to make a website for my sister to sell her prints on but I didn’t want to disappoint my sister with my mediocre HTML skills so I called that off. The idea I gave to my professor was a website for Dota 2 tutorials. I liked the idea up until I had to explain to the class Dota 2 and make garbage videos from Sony Vegas on how to play Dota 2 from people that I’m assuming don’t play video games. I figured from my previous post that I would just do a glorified portfolio/resume for my website.</p>

<h2>Lazy but Efficient, I think? </h2> 
<h3>November 12th, 2019 </h3>

<p>I am starting this website out for school on a late day.  I’m just going to be efficient and use the same framework from the homework but add my own flair to it. I haven’t been in class so I’m not 100% sure if that allowed but I’m going to use it anyway because I am efficient (lazy).</p>

<br>

<p> The last thing I want to have to worry about is the css and just make a simple portfolio for future employers to be able to see. Always a cut above the rest when you have a website for people to read. I’m not trying to create a YouTube nor am I competing with Facebook so I’m making my website as simple as possible. Also, will be nice to have a blog so I can actually write stuff in here once in a while.</p>

<br>

<p>The guidelines say to have 9 pages but I’m not confident in what those 9 pages will bring to my website besides nonsense. I’m fairly certain my grade will be affected by it but I’m making this website for my future so I’m not going to bother cluttering the website with a bunch of pages I don’t see any need for.
